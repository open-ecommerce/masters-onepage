			One could very well say that Argentineans and their dulce de leche are inseparable. A trip to Argentina is not complete without a taste of this decadent, creamy, sweet delicacy. Dulce de leche pancakes are featured highlights in any traditional Argentinean restaurant menu.  Sure to fulfill that sweet tooth when you're craving something sweet, these pancakes filled with gooey sweet deliciousness are also extremely simple to make! Start out with a basic crepe recipe, pile on the dulce de leche to taste.. y listo! A disfrutar!


			Ingredients:

			1 cup flour

			1/2 cup milk

			1/2 cup water

			2 eggs

			2 tablespoons melted butter, plus extra to coat the pan

			Jar of store-bought dulce de leche
			 

			Directions:

			Sift the flour.

			Combine all of the wet ingredients: water, milk, eggs, and melted butter into the flour.

			Let the dough rest in the fridge for an hour.

			Heat up the pan and brush some butter on it.

			Laddle on the batter and quickly swirl it to the edges of the pan to spread it evenly until you have a very thin dough.

			Let cook until it sets, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds.

			Keep warm while you do the rest.

			Spread about 1 tablespoon of dulce de leche onto each pancake and roll up. If you wish you can also sift some powdered sugar on top.

			Serve and eat warm.
